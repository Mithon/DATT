                <p class="statement">Thinking is concept so vague and abstract that there are very little concrete facts about it. We like to think we are in control of our own minds, that we control the ‘thinker’ buried within. However as we grow, we let this ‘thinker’ take control and dictate our thoughts. It drags us away from reality, the present. The power of now is lost in the chaos of our own mind. We drift away from our friends, our family, our goals in our own life as the thinker in our head carries us deeper in the depths of worry, stress and self doubt. This sense of not feeling ‘there’ or feeling ‘spaced-out’ eventually progresses to a deep sense of depersonalization. Some live their entire lives in this blurry state, leaving the wonders of the present in the background. Always worried of the future and regretful of the past. </p>
				<p class="statement">However there is hope, we can tame this ‘thinker’ and use it to our advantage. We can rise out of the rut and back into the present. It is this sense of hope that drove me to create this piece. The idea that we can use our mind as a tool. To longer be a slave to the ‘thinker’ inside of us. The voices in our head are calling to us, but the voices of the people who love are stronger.  Focusing on breath is the backbone of remaining in the present. Breath is always present, and by taking notice of our breath we become present as well. </p>
				<p class="statement">This piece focuses on being lost in our mental space, and trying to move back to the present. The journey back to becoming firmly placed in reality. Many of us have important people in our lives who are willing to help us make that journey, although we may find it hard to communicate to them. This journey isn’t easy, but your friends and loved ones can help support you. You just need to give them a chance.</p>
